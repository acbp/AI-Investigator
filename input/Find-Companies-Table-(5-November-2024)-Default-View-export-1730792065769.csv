Then, BizAm connects those business leaders with automation development companies who have proven experience implementing the automation solutions shown.

BizAm is the brainchild of Alvin Cordeiro who has been creatively finding ways to automate his computer-related tasks since he started his first company in 1995 from the basement of his home in San Jose California. His enthusiasm for using automation as a means to create higher efficiencies in the office stemmed from his humble beginning of starting businesses on a shoe-string budget that required him to produce more with less energy and cost.

When Mr. Cordeiro discovered Robotic Process Automation (RPA) in 2017, he immediately recognized it as an opportunity to help businesses accelerate towards their performance goals without making significant changes to their computer systems and processes.

With the BOOM of interest in the computer-automation industry, Mr. Cordeiro launched BizAm to solve the problem that RPA can be confusing and perceived as unaffordable for small and medium-sized business owners. Another challenge BizAm aims to address is communicating the value of automation to business leaders who think they are already maximizing the performance of the software they have.

,"Innodocs","""CloudOS"" is an operating system for the cloud, scalable from embedded solutions (eg in routers, DLS modems, set-top boxes), to enterprise solutions (thousands and tens of thousands of users) to SaaS supporting millions of users.

The system provides offers a full suite of office/productivity applications such as Writer, Spreadsheet, Presentation, Website Builder, Mail, Drive, Calendar, Contacts, Task Manager, Blogger, together with a development platform consisting of programming interfaces (APIs) and various software tooling that together allow for the extension of the system and the addition of new applications and facilities.

We have designed 'CloudOS' with two major goals in mind:

1. - to continue to allow you, our customer, to enjoy all the benefits of cloud deployments for your IT needs, but let you re-take control of your data (security). By enabling you to easily deploy full-featured private/hybrid clouds, you decide how and where your sensitive data resides, and who has access to it. You are now in control, and not your 3rd party cloud provider.

2. - by making available a full stack of software applications for the cloud, together with extension APIs, you do not need to re-invent the wheel every time you decide to augment your IT infrastructure with new applications and services. By smartly picking and choosing existing applications from the InnoDocs/CloudOS stack, we are able to custom-build enterprise-level cloud apps for you in a matter of months instead of years. As trusted 3rd party developers add their creations to our App Store these timeframes will be reduced even further, providing you with unparalleled ROI.

And when none of our pre-built applications fit your needs, our suite of AI/ML code generation tools (""GenTools"") will allow us to create entirely new software applications for you in a fraction of the time typically quoted by our competitors.

,"Tecton","Founded by the team that created the Uber Michelangelo platform, Tecton provides an enterprise-ready AI data platform to help companies activate their data for AI applications. 

AI creates new opportunities to generate more value than ever before from data. Companies can now build AI-driven applications to automate decisions at machine speed, deliver magical customer experiences, and re-invent business processes. 

But AI models will only ever be as good as the data that is fed to them. Today, its incredibly hard to build and manage AI data. Most companies dont have access to the advanced AI data infrastructure that is used by the Internet giants. So AI teams spend the majority of their time building bespoke data pipelines, and most models never make it to production.

We believe that companies need a new kind of data platform built for the unique requirements of AI. Tecton enables AI teams to easily and reliably compute, manage, and retrieve data for both generative AI and predictive ML applications. Our platform delivers features, embeddings, and prompts as rich, unified context, abstracting away the complex engineering involved in data preparation for AI. With Tecton, companies can:

1. Productionize context faster, getting new models to production 80% faster
2. Build more accurate models through rapid data experimentation and 100% accurate context serving
3. Drive down production costs by turning expensive workloads into highly efficient data services

We believe that by getting the data layer for AI right, companies can get better models to production faster, driving real business outcomes. Tecton enables organizations to harness the full potential of their data, creating AI applications that are contextually aware and truly intelligent.","Software Development","51-200 employees","Privately Held","San Francisco, California","United States","tecton.ai","https://www.linkedin.com/company/tectonai"

,"Kizen","Kizen is the first platform to combine a Gen AI CoBuilder with intuitive drag-and-drop interfaces to help teams build and perfect real, enterprise applications 10X faster with 95% less coding.
_________
Origin story
In an era of rising expectations, most organizations are struggling to keep up, with only 7% able to meet these demands. John Winner and Scott Turner, Co-founders of Kizen, witnessed firsthand how the inflexibility and high customization costs of leading legacy tools - all built in the late 1990s and early 2000s - leave employees frustrated, teams understaffed, and customers dissatisfied. In a world of rapid evolution, why are so many businesses still relying on outdated platforms that no longer meet the dynamic needs of todays enterprises?

After 11 years of consulting with leading legacy tools, John and Scott realized that while the providers tried their best, the softwares limitations were too overwhelming. It was time to challenge the status quo and open minds to the next generation of technology designed for speed, efficiency and real impact. It was seeing teams struggle with multiple tools not meeting their needs and the incredible potential of automation and AI to enrich lives and drive business success that sparked the creation of Kizen.

Traffic crashes have been an ongoing epidemic and despite advancements in technology, supportive regulatory changes, and improvements in road infrastructures, the number of traffic fatalities is still increasing.

Founded 9 years ago, Zendrive is a mobility risk intelligence provider with a mission to make roads safer using data and analytics. Our patent-protected AI and machine learning algorithms turn raw smartphone sensor data into meaningful insights such as speeding, hard barking, phone usage, and even collision events. Over the past nine years, we have amassed one of the largest smartphone-centric databases of over 200 billion miles of data from over 100 million users across the globe. 

Our research shows that the most effective way to make roads safer and to save precious lives is to ensure improvements in driving behavior through behavioral coaching and incentives and provide timely support in the moments of truth. Right now, the most obvious and direct mechanism for behavioral improvements through incentives is by giving drivers the opportunity to earn discounts on their auto insurance based on their driving behavior. 

At Zendrive, we believe that your risk as a driver is better demonstrated by how you drive than by where you live and other demographic factors such as age or gender. Saving money is a powerful motivator and if Zendrive can, through engaging behavior-based driver coaching experiences, help drivers save money on car insurance then we can also take measured steps toward our mission of making roads safer using data and analytics.","Software Development","51-200 employees","Privately Held","San Francisco, California","United States","zendrive.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/zendrive"

Our mission is to improve the way people communicate at work. Lots of companies are already migrating to instant messaging and other fast communication methods, but they are still up against many challenges.

We want to help every team member find balance between instant and focus. Hubgets uses artificial intelligence to learn about each user's communication behavior, and acts based on the Happiness Index it computes. We care about each person, every minute, in order to make the whole team more productive. Knowledge is indexed and organized, so basically any team using Hubgets will naturally accumulate experience that can be easily exchanged.

Our Vision: Become the best integrated self-service platform for citizen data analysts and scientist to derive insights from data across the enterprise in a seamless end-to-end experience.

*Business Problems Sparkflows is Going After:* --
1/ Data is growing at an accelerated rate and silos of data are emerging. Secondly, the growing options for compute clusters that support different types of workloads, makes it hard for organizations to understand and leveraging the most optimal compute to power data-driven decisions across the enterprise.

2/ Building data applications has a steep learning curve and the proliferation of fast evolving platforms and tools at different altitudes of the technology stack, requires users to develop several new skills and makes it challenging to solve for the business needs in a seamless manner and further slows down the journey of an organization towards becoming data-driven.

3/ Customers are trying to move fast at various levels of the organization and adopting various technologies without fully understanding the incompatibilities and only solve for a part of the E2E user journey. This further complicates the E2E user journey, forcing more integrations and drastically delaying time to value.

*Sparkflows Offering: A self-serve data analytics platform called Fire Insights* --
1/ A drag and drop workflow designer to minimize coding to create an E2E data application.

2/ A large number of connectors and processors to connect with diverse data sources, understand schema, prep and blend data, train and manage ML models.

3/ With native integrations to enable push-down analytics to Snowflake, Databricks and AWS Glue etc. Sparkflows enables users to execute data applications on the most appropriate compute cluster or on customers' choice of compute.","Software Development","51-200 employees","Privately Held","San Jose, CA","United States","sparkflows.io","https://www.linkedin.com/company/sparkflows"
