GitLab, the leading AI-powered DevSecOps platform, adopted Claude for Work to empower teams to create high-quality content, gain deeper data insights, and accelerate sales cycles. During an initial pilot program, GitLab saw the following gains from incorporating Claude into key workflows:

- 98% of GitLab team members surveyed reported to be satisfied or very satisfied with Claude for Work
- 25 - 50% productivity gains
- Significant time savings in RFP responses and content generation
- Improved collaboration and skill sharing across teams
- Team members more likely to take on complex tasks

### Empowering teams across GitLab with Claude

GitLab saw AI's potential to transform their product offerings through the Anthropic API and their internal processes with the Claude Enterprise plan.

Taylor McCaslin, product lead for AI and ML tech at GitLab, is focused on putting Claude’s AI capabilities in the hands of team members across departments, from engineering to marketing. McCaslin says, "By using the same Claude models internally that we offer externally, we're better able to build AI solutions that we trust and use ourselves."

### Choosing Claude

GitLab was impressed with Anthropic's commitment to data privacy and user protections. "We agree with Anthropic's focus on alignment, trust, and safety, that all felt incredibly aligned and ready for business at scale," McCaslin notes.

After initially integrating Anthropic’s API to add Claude to their product offerings, GitLab has steadily expanded its use across the organization. The company recently adopted Claude for Work, bringing AI capabilities to internal GitLab team members across a variety of functions. Features like SSO have greatly streamlined this process, making it easier and more secure to control team member access to Claude.

Claude's advanced capabilities and human-like communication style influenced GitLab's decision to adopt the Claude Enterprise plan. One of Claude's key advantages is its expanded context window, which allows for more natural and context-aware conversations. McCaslin emphasizes, "It's a game-changer. I can have extensive conversations with Claude while maintaining the context of the entire chat."

### Streamlining workflows across departments

GitLab has discovered a wide range of use cases for Claude across various departments, improving how teams collaborate and work. As McCaslin shares, "We are finding endless use cases for Claude. It's the most utilized new tool I've seen."

GitLab team members reported using Claude for Work across use cases, including writing, brainstorming, research, and problem-solving. These use cases support more specific workflows across the organization:

- RFP responses: The sales team uses Claude to quickly generate and customize responses to RFPs, saving significant time on repetitive tasks.
- Content creation and translation: The marketing team uses Claude to efficiently generate and translate content.
- Documentation: Technical writers use Claude to rewrite and improve documentation, ensuring consistency and clarity.
- Internal tool development: Developers use Claude to create small applications and scripts, introducing new automation into their workflows.
- Data analysis: Teams upload reports and use Claude to ask questions and gain insights from the data.

### Transformative impact and productivity gains

The impact of Claude extends beyond individual use cases, fostering a culture of efficiency, empowerment, and collaboration. "Everyone who uses Claude emphasizes that it enhances productivity. That is consistent across the board,” says McCaslin.

GitLab team members are taking on more complex tasks, using Claude as an extension of their capabilities. McCaslin shares, “Claude offers our team members a tool that feels like an extension of their work and expertise, allowing us to take on more complex tasks and deliver greater impact while ensuring GitLab’s IP remains private and protected.”

The ability to share specific chats has also fostered a collaborative environment around AI use. Team members are eager to share their experiences and discoveries with their colleagues. "There's a variety of people sharing links to chats to show the cool things they've done. The collaboration aspect is very powerful," McCaslin notes.

### Looking to the future

GitLab is eager to integrate Claude into its products further through the Anthropic API and drive adoption of Claude AI internally, spurring innovation and adding value for customers and team members alike.

McCaslin sees the partnership between GitLab and Anthropic as a key driver of this future. "We continue to be impressed," McCaslin says. "Anthropic is a leader on the model development front, particularly at the speed of releasing models. The models are constantly getting better, faster, and cheaper. Together, we're not just adapting to the AI revolution - we're leading it."
