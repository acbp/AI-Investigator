Brandon Jung, VP of Ecosystem, says, \"Think of it as delivering the right suggestion at the right time in the right place. It can help you write, explain, and test code.\"\n\nClaude's versatility allows Tabnine to support developers across various aspects of the software development lifecycle. In addition to helping them understand the codebase they're working with, Tabnine handles tedious tasks like test generation, refactoring, and migrating code to new versions or languages.\n\n### Claude's security and performance meet Tabnine's high standards\n\nTabnine prioritizes privacy, security, and personalization. Initially, it used a proprietary in-house LLM, but that was a temporary measure. To improve the developer experience, they searched for a more sophisticated LLM, leading them to Claude.\n\nDuring evaluation, Jung says the team was impressed by Claude 3.5 Sonnet\u2019s quality of code explanations and accuracy in code completion. Claude also excelled in test generation, covering ticky edge cases buried deep in the code. After evaluating competitors, they found that Claude delivered superior performance in real-world developer scenarios.\n\nBut it was Claude's security posture that sealed the deal. Tabnine has strict criteria around safeguarding customer' data when evaluating LLMs \u2013 a must for users in regulated industries and the EU. Access to Claude in Amazon Bedrock was also key. This enables Tabnine to comply with customers' security practices, and partnering with a trusted infrastructure provider gives customers additional peace of mind.\n\n### Higher conversion rates and lower churn since adding Claude\n\nTabnine has enhanced the value it delivers to individual developers and engineering organizations by integrating Claude. They measure Claude's impact through real-world usage data, like generating summaries of code or documentation, which is 50% faster than other models they've tested.\n\nTabnine has seen a 20% increase in free-to-paid user conversions since integrating Claude, as well as a 20-30% decrease in monthly customer churn. Customers have shared stories with Jung and his team about Tabnine's impact, calling it best-in-class. In fact, once they see the value in the context of coding, they often expand usage into customer service and internal knowledge management, making Tabnine \u201cstickier\u201d within organizations.\n\n### Tabnine's vision for AI in software development\n\nTabnine envisions a future where development teams use multiple specialized AI models for different coding tasks. They aim to be the intelligent interface orchestrating these models, with Claude playing a central role. Jung predicts, \"In a year, big banks and large companies will have 10+ different specialized Claude models.\"\n\nTabnine is excited about using Claude for various development process aspects, from code generation to documentation. They're particularly interested in exploring Claude's latest capabilities, such as its enhanced performance in understanding and generating code. With Claude, Tabnine is at the forefront of AI-assisted software development, driving innovation in how developers and teams interact with AI to build better software more efficiently.\n\n[Share on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=https://www.anthropic.com/customers/tabnine)[Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.anthropic.com/customers/tabnine)",
