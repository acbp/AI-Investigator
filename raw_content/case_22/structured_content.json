He explains, \"The tools that writers and editors use in their workflow aren't nearly as good as those used by programmers and designers.\" Baschez envisioned a platform that could rival industry-standard creative tools like Adobe Photoshop, but for writing.\n\nThe Lex team initially focused on improving the user interface for writers, addressing pain points like cumbersome track changes. However, they soon realized the potential of generative AI to enhance the writing process, offering benefits like instant feedback, idea generation, and personalized learning.\n\n### Choosing Claude for a more human touch\n\nAfter experimenting with various large language models, Lex chose Claude as their primary AI model for its tone, cost, and quality of output.\n\nBaschez described Claude's output as more natural and human-like. \"Claude is like a sage editor. Its tone and personality give its answers a smarter, more human vibe. It feels less bullet point-y and less robot-generated.\"\n\n\u201cCost was another consideration,\u201d notes Baschez. \u201cA 50% reduction in cost from a competitive model we had previously used was helpful to the business!\u201d\n\nLex's decision to use Claude was also based on qualitative improvements in user experience. Baschez explains, \"We focus on how the advice impacts users emotionally. It's like casting the right actor - Claude's 'voice' matched the brand and user experience we wanted to create.\"\n\n### Transforming the writing process with AI assistance\n\nLex leverages Claude in several key ways to enhance the writing experience:\n\n- AI-powered comments: Users can tag the AI in comments for specific feedback or revisions on highlighted text.\n- High-level document feedback: Claude provides comprehensive feedback, identifying weak arguments and suggesting improvements.\n- Customizable prompts: Users can create and share saved prompts for consistent feedback across teams or projects.\n- Style and brevity checks: Claude helps refine prose by suggesting ways to streamline text and adhere to style guidelines.\n\n![Lex product image](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F563a3f8f68e4ea02b8c063f6595bfd5abb668f0b-1920x1080.jpg&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Driving impact for Lex and its users\n\nAdopting Claude immediately boosted growth and user satisfaction for Lex. Within 24 hours of launching their AI-powered features, Lex saw an explosive 25,000 new signups. After fully implementing Claude, Lex had a 20-30% reduction in monthly churn and a 50% decrease in cost.\n\nThe impact on individual writers has been equally impressive. Nathan shares, \u201cLex has helped me build confidence and publish in a way I never could have or would have before. It makes writing feel less agonizing and anxiety-inducing to have real feedback to work against.\u201d\n\nThis sentiment resonates across Lex's diverse user base, from business professionals to academics to creative writers. Users consistently report increased confidence, productivity, and willingness to tackle challenging writing projects. Baschez adds, \"Before AI, very few people had access to a good editor. Now, anyone can have instant access to high-quality writing assistance.\"\n\nWith Claude, Lex has created a writing environment that feels like collaborating with a knowledgeable, supportive editor rather than a robotic assistant. This human-like interaction has transformed the writing process for thousands of users, helping them overcome writer\u2019s block and produce higher-quality content.\n\n### Looking forward\n\nAs Lex evolves, Baschez and his team focus on refining the user experience, creating an interface for writers to compare versions, collaborate with AI, and navigate complex writing projects with ease.\n\nThis approach lets Lex play to its strengths while leveraging Anthropic's AI expertise. \"We're focused on improving our application layer, while Anthropic is focused on developing even better models for us to use,\u201d Baschez notes.\n\nWith Claude, Lex aims to set a new standard for digital writing tools to make the writing process more efficient and rewarding while unlocking new realms of creativity and productivity for writers across all domains.\n\n> AI can help you agonize less while writing, getting work done faster. But it can also push you to think more deeply about your content. By facilitating fluid revisions and offering diverse perspectives, Claude will ultimately help create better writing for everyone.\n\n_\u2014_ Nathan Baschez, Founder and CEO\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: This case study was written with help from Lex!\n\n[Share on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=https://www.anthropic.com/customers/lex)[Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.anthropic.com/customers/lex)",
