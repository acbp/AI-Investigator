OrI'd have to search sites like Dribbble, Mobbin, or one of the many UX pattern repositories out there \u2014 trying to visually parse if something was solving a similar problem to the one I was designing for.\n\n**Magic Patterns bridges knowledge gaps**, accelerating the learning process and enabling designers of all experience levels to reach better solutions more quickly.\n\nInnovations such as Magic Patterns and its screenshot-to-code feature is helping us get past the blank page problem. Tools like this are moving designers into the role of curator and design instructor, rather than simply production designer. Sometimes I feel like Magic Patterns is my intern. Definitely helping me move faster in more directions in parallel.\n\nIt's made my current workflow even faster.Existing tools are\ngreat for visual design, but when it comes to pattern ideation\nthat's specific to your use case - that's so much harder to find\nand **Magic Patterns gets the job done**.\n\nSteve WitmerDesign Co-Founder\n\n[![Roster](https://www.magicpatterns.com/case-studies/roster/roster-landing-page.png)](https://onroster.io/)\n\nRoster\n\nThe future of work for entertainment production and crew\n\n[onroster.io](https://onroster.io/)\n\nFoundedSan Diego, 2023\n\nUsing Magic Patterns sinceMay 2024\n\nFavorite featureDesign inspiration\n\n![Magic Patterns Logo](https://www.magicpatterns.com/patterns_logo_gs.svg)Magic Patterns\n\n[All Systems Operational](https://magicpatterns.statuspage.io/)\n\n[Visit Magic Patterns' Twitter](https://twitter.com/magicpatterns)[Visit Magic Patterns' Github](https://github.com/magicpatterns)[Visit Magic Patterns' LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/magicpatterns)[Join Magic Patterns' Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/magic-patterns/shared_invite/zt-1ps2xtxh0-2NaixFfFzSKZbr5gw_AHfA)\n\nOverview\n\nGet Started\n\n[Documentation](https://www.magicpatterns.com/docs/documentation/get-started/introduction) [Prompting Guide](https://www.magicpatterns.com/docs/documentation/get-started/prompting)\n\nProduct\n\nPricing\n\n[Security](https://www.magicpatterns.com/docs/documentation/enterprise/security) [Contact Sales](https://cal.com/adanilowicz/generating-custom-ui-with-patterns)\n\nUse Cases [Product](/teams/product) [Designers](/teams/designers) [Founders](/teams/startups) [Sales](/teams/sales)\n\nCompany [Blog](/blog) [Customers](/customers) [Careers](https://magicpatterns.notion.site/magicpatterns/Jobs-at-Magic-Patterns-56c741e19619434daaf2968f443ee992) [Social Media](https://twitter.com/magicpatterns)\n\nLegal\n\nContact\n\n[Acceptable Use](https://www.magicpatterns.com/docs/documentation/legal/acceptable-use) [Terms](https://www.magicpatterns.com/docs/documentation/legal/terms) [Privacy Policy](https://www.magicpatterns.com/docs/documentation/legal/privacy)\n\n\u00a9 North Park Labs 2024",
