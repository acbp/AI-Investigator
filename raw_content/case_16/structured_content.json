As an experienced engineer, she recognized that traditional development incentives and timelines didn't align with new AI capabilities. Headstart helps companies implement AI effectively to speed up their development process. \"I started it by taking on projects I knew I could complete. And then all of a sudden, I could complete a lot more,\" Hedley explains.\n\n### Why Headstart chose Claude\n\nHeadstart uses multiple AI models but defaults to Claude for most coding tasks. After the release of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, they went all-in on Claude, attracted by its superior performance and user experience. \"When Sonnet 3.5 launched, I once again defaulted to it,\" explains Hedley. She particularly values Claude's intuitive interface, noting \"I much prefer Anthropic's UX. I think it's great.\" The ability to work with individual files, easily copy-paste, and Claude's responsiveness make it her go-to tool. Despite having access to AI-integrated code editors, Hedley consistently chooses Claude's native interface: \"I find it so much easier and faster to use through the Claude UX than through a code editor.\"\n\n![Headstart product screenshot](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fc33d6b4c10e8803e0e96720015ca7ec0ea1fbd4c-1920x966.jpg&w=3840&q=75)\n\nFor Headstart's enterprise clients in industries like healthcare and financial services, data privacy is paramount. The team leverages Claude's projects feature to work with entire codebases while maintaining the security their clients require. This combination of powerful features and trust has made Claude indispensable to their workflow.\n\n### How Claude transforms software development\n\nClaude enables Headstart to revolutionize their development process in unprecedented ways. At the core of this transformation is Claude's ability to generate nearly all of the required code for clients automatically. \"Claude does 90 to 97% of the code implementation so I can focus my time on architecture design & problem solving,\" says Hedley.\n\nThis automation extends to rapid application development. Hedley can build entire applications in a fraction of the traditional time. She notes, \"I built an entire iPhone app for a client on Friday just using screenshots. It's absolutely mind blowing to me.\"\n\n![Headstart produt screenshot](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F532ba2dd7f6dc7479b55782d035e967e8ecae2a8-1920x1034.jpg&w=3840&q=75)\n\nClaude's extensive context window has also transformed their approach to handling large codebases. When the 200K context window was released, Hedley notes they \"ripped out the entire RAG and just put it in the context window instead and it went from 60 percent accuracy to 98. It was quicker, cheaper, better, everything.\" This combination of automation, speed, and accuracy has fundamentally changed how Headstart approaches software development.\n\n### Transforming client expectations and outcomes\n\nBy leveraging Claude, Headstart has changed what's possible in software development timelines and costs. They can quote clients timelines that are 10x faster than industry standard - and consistently deliver. For one recent project, they completed in two weeks what the client CTO estimated would take 4-8 months. This allows Headstart to operate on a flat-fee model rather than hourly billing, passing on the efficiency gains to clients.\n\nThe impact extends beyond just speed. Their ability to handle multiple complex projects simultaneously demonstrates the transformative power of AI-native development. As Hedley notes, \"The more you can do, the more there is to do.\" This approach appeals to forward-thinking clients wanting to leverage cutting-edge technology for competitive advantages.\n\n### Looking toward an AI-native future\n\nHedley envisions a future where AI handles implementation details, freeing humans to focus on high-level problem solving and innovation. She explains, \"I have this picture of the AI coding and people doing the fun stuff like having conversations, solving problems, and whiteboarding.\" She believes the development paradigm will shift, potentially eliminating traditional coding environments: \"If the AI is truly coding, it doesn't need a coding editor, so what does that look like?\"\n\nFor Headstart, the goal is to remain \"AI-native\" as they grow, using tools like Claude to maintain exponential productivity gains instead of scaling linearly with headcount. \"My hypothesis is software engineers will be way more expensive, and the expertise will be more important with what good looks like, and how to plug the pieces together.\" They're excited to push the boundaries with Anthropic, seeing each update as an opportunity to revolutionize software development.\n\n> I think Claude is the greatest thing in the world. I can't believe more people don't use it. I really am shocked.\n\n\u2014 Nicole Hedley, Headstart Co-founder\n\n[Share on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=https://www.anthropic.com/customers/headstart)[Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.anthropic.com/customers/headstart)",
