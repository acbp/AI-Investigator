MagicSchool, an AI copilot for educators and students, transforms education with Claude by streamlining lesson planning, providing personalized student feedback, and creating engaging content for students.

With Claude, MagicSchool supports:

- 3 million educators actively using the platform
- Over 100 million AI-powered engagements
- 5,500+ school & district partnerships
- 1 million students reached through teacher-guided AI interactions

### Tackling teacher burnout with AI assistance

MagicSchool uses AI to help teachers save time on administrative tasks and prep work so they can focus on student interaction. "Educators experience burnout at higher rates than any other profession," says Adeel Khan, a career teacher and founder of MagicSchool. This burnout not only affects teachers, but also the quality of education students receive.

With simple prompting from teachers, MagicSchool’s platform can generate over a dozen artifacts – from curriculum plans and quizzes to behavior support plans and report card comments.

MagicSchool also helps teachers build responsible AI experiences for students. Instead of using AI to do their thinking for them, students turn to MagicSchool to get early feedback on their assignments or generate images and thought partnership that add depth to their work. These guardrails help kids build AI habits grounded in integrity under the guidance of their teachers.

### Choosing Claude for security, accuracy, and educational alignment

MagicSchool transitioned many of its tools from OpenAI to Claude due to its alignment with their core values around responsible AI use in education. Anthropic’s “minimal risk” rating from Common Sense Media—in contrast to OpenAI’s “moderate risk” rating—was particularly compelling.

“When Anthropic came on the scene, the responsibility narrative and commitment to constitutional AI got us really excited,” Khan recalls. “Especially because our core audience places enormous value on privacy, safety, and responsible AI use.” For example, their Individual Education Plan (IEP) generator drafts comprehensive plans based on teacher observations while protecting student privacy. "If you accidentally include the student's name, the AI removes it in the background," explains Khan.

MagicSchool also saw the difference Claude could make for their business. In A/B testing, they found Claude consistently produced more challenging and creative worksheets, along with more reliable answer keys. According to Khan, "Claude stood out for its accuracy, speed, and ability to understand complex educational concepts.”

### How Claude powers personalized learning experiences

With Claude, MagicSchool is transforming how teachers work, allowing them to reclaim nights and weekends that had previously been consumed by background tasks. For instance, MagicSchool's spiral review tool uses Claude to generate pedagogically sound and intellectually stimulating math problems. "Claude is almost always accurate for K-12 math, and creates the types of problems teachers actually want to use with students,” said Khan.

For students, the platform’s writing feedback tool exemplifies responsible AI-assisted learning. Teachers can customize assessment criteria for each assignment. Students then upload their drafts and receive instant, constructive feedback aligned with teacher expectations. "The student gets a low-stakes opportunity to improve their essay before turning it in," Khan explains. "The teacher gets higher quality essays to grade." Students can also engage with the AI about the feedback, deepening their understanding.

MagicSchool's commitment to "human-in-the-loop" AI assistance is reflected in these tools. By handling administrative tasks, MagicSchool's Claude-powered platform frees educators to focus on meaningful student interactions.

> AI will never replace a teacher. It's the teacher's expertise that makes a difference, and AI is the assistant.

— Adeel Khan, founder of Magic School

### Measurable impact on education and business growth

MagicSchool's impact on education is both immediate and far-reaching. Khan says, "We're the fastest growing technology platform for schools ever," with over 3 million educators and 1 million students actively using the platform. Their reach extends to every school and district in America, and many more worldwide.

The platform's ability to save teachers time has improved student outcomes. Aurora Public Schools in Colorado reported significant advancements in state performance ratings, with schools showing the greatest improvements having high concentrations of MagicSchool users. As Khan explains, "When teachers get their time back, we trust teachers to repurpose it effectively." Whether it's calling a family about a struggling student or providing extra emotional support, teachers use their reclaimed time to enhance student experiences.

Another large district partner in South Carolina declared MagicSchool "the single most powerful tool that’s ever been launched in our district." This enthusiasm is reflected in the platform's usage statistics - over 100 million AI-powered engagements to date. Khan notes that outside of coding assistant tools, MagicSchool may be "the most used domain-specific AI tool in the world," indicating that "when you think about professions that have embraced AI, it probably goes: programmers, engineers, and then educators – which is remarkable and largely unreported."

MagicSchool's impact on special education has also been profound. At a conference, one teacher approached Khan, sharing that when her colleague quit, leaving her with numerous IEPs to complete in two weeks, MagicSchool's IEP generator prevented her from quitting too. Khan notes, "While sad for the students to have one teacher, and the burden falling on an educator at that moment, is not an uncommon story in public schools. When we provide teachers this kind of support, it is life-changing for that teacher, but also for their students."

The platform's commitment to privacy and responsible AI use has earned them unprecedented recognition in education technology. Their 93% privacy rating from Common Sense Media significantly outperforms other AI platforms. Khan emphasized, "We take this very, very seriously."

### A bright future for AI-enhanced education

MagicSchool envisions a future where AI increases efficiency and fundamentally transforms the educational experience. Khan believes AI can help solve the "intractable problem" of teacher burnout while also empowering students to pursue their passions in unprecedented ways.

Khan believes we're on the verge of a creative revolution in education. He envisions a shift from traditional standardized experiences to more meaningful project-based learning: "What if we asked students to do things that were more tangible and relatable so they build a portfolio of real-world achievements in school?" His team is building for a future where students can use AI to explore complex topics, create ambitious projects, and even produce professional-quality work while still in school.

With Anthropic, MagicSchool is pushing the boundaries of what's possible in education. Their goal is to create a more authentic, efficient, and personalized learning environment that benefits both educators and students. As Khan says, "School can be so much more inspiring when kids have access to these tools."
