On one end, there are hyper-advanced users who spend hundreds of dollars weekly on AI interactions, chatting with AI characters for hours using open-source clients and their own API keys. On the other end\u2014particularly among those over 40\u2014many are unfamiliar with AI technology. As Djay Lee, CPO and co-founder at WRTN, explains, \"There's a big gap between early adopters who are really into this technology and the masses who don't know how to use it properly. We focus on bridging that gap.\" By making sophisticated AI technology accessible to everyday users, WRTN is closing this divide between power users and the mainstream population, potentially reaching millions in the densely populated, tech-savvy market who haven't yet embraced AI.\n\n### Building an AI platform for Asia\n\nWRTN operates as a consumer AI aggregator, making advanced AI technology accessible to users in South Korea and Japan. Their approach follows a proven pattern in Asian markets, where local tech startups have successfully competed with global players by aggregating services and creating deeply loyal customer bases in densely populated areas. \"In the last couple of decades in Korea, Japan, and the broader Asian market, we've seen local tech startups outcompete big techs by aggregating and localizing services and creating high loyalty customers in a dense population,\" explained Lee.\n\nWRTN's platform aggregates AI services across three key domains: companionship, entertainment, and productivity. This approach allows them to cater to a wide range of user needs, from personal AI assistants to creative writing tools and productivity enhancers. By focusing on these core areas, WRTN is positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for AI-powered solutions in daily life and work contexts across Asian markets.\n\n![WRTN screenshot](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F7dc49adfd9d43a169da504d9b4ef290ee3469f0b-1920x990.jpg&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Transforming digital entertainment and connection\n\nIn Korea's fast-paced, urban environment, where maintaining traditional social connections is challenging, AI fills a crucial role. \"If you're living in the city, you want to have meaningful connections with your friends, families, and loved ones. But often, you can't be and you're very lonely,\" explained Lee. WRTN's platform addresses this need through interactive storytelling and AI companionship.\n\nThe platform has revolutionized how users engage with creative content. Instead of passive consumption of web novels or comics, users now actively participate in dynamic stories. \"Before this product, I spent 20 to 50 bucks a month for web novels and webtoons. Now I just use the character chat because it writes endless stories just for you,\" said Lee.\n\n### How Claude powers creative engagement\n\nThrough Claude, WRTN enhances its platform with AI capabilities. In entertainment, Claude powers hundreds of thousands of interactive story characters, creating experiences that transcend traditional storytelling. \"It's not just about adventure gaming and role play,\" said Lee. \"A big part of it is consuming a story. You don't know exactly where Claude's taking you, but sometimes you end up in a really entertaining and cool plot and world.\"\n\nFor companionship, WRTN leverages Claude's conversational abilities to develop AI companions that engage in meaningful dialogue while maintaining appropriate boundaries. Unlike character interactions with specific storytelling roles, these companion experiences aim to create \"a new form of socialization between a human and an AI,\" explained Lee. The company carefully tests different models to ensure these interactions feel natural, meaningful, and safe.\n\nFor productivity, Claude helps users enhance their written communication with more natural, polished language. \"We use Claude for rewriting,\" said Lee, noting that Claude\u2019s ability to understand and maintain context makes it effective.\n\n### Why WRTN chose Claude\n\nWRTN selected Claude for its superior ability to engage naturally with users, particularly in Korean. \"Claude has a more natural Korean tone and emulates human language better, understands intent, and knows how to speak sentimentally,\" said Lee. They also chose Claude for its ability to strictly follow prompts compared to other models, making it ideal for character-based interactions.\n\nThese capabilities mark the beginning of WRTN's vision of a fundamental transformation in human-AI interaction. As the technology evolves and becomes more accessible, WRTN is positioning itself at the forefront of this cultural shift in Korea and beyond.\n\n### Looking ahead to an AI-augmented future\n\nWRTN envisions a future where AI unlocks new realms of human creativity and connection, especially in tech-forward markets like South Korea. \"AI enables deeply personal experiences at scale,\" said Lee, emphasizing AI's potential to enhance human interactions. Although urban life can challenge traditional connections, WRTN views AI as a tool to boost creativity, expression, and relationships. Expanding across Asia, WRTN plans to use Claude's capabilities to realize these possibilities, creating new channels for imagination and connection. Their vision celebrates AI's potential to amplify what makes us human\u2014our creativity, our need for connection, and our drive to explore new frontiers of experience.\n\n[Share on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=https://www.anthropic.com/customers/wrtn)[Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.anthropic.com/customers/wrtn)",
