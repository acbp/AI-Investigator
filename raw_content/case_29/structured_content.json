Sourcegraph uses Claude to power its AI Coding assistant, [Cody](https://www.anthropic.com/customers/sourcegraph). And now, Sourcegraph is using Claude for Work to transform community feedback into actionable insights for their product team.\n\nWith Claude, Sourcegraph efficiently:\n\n- Accelerates community feedback analysis\n- Increases product team's responsiveness to user needs\n- Simplifies competitor sentiment analysis\n\n### Synthesizing community feedback for product development\n\nSourcegraph helps developers search, understand, and automate changes across large codebases. With a focus on open-source sustainability and community engagement, the company needed to efficiently process and action feedback from their diverse user base.\n\nJustin Dorfman, Open Source Community Manager at Sourcegraph explains, \"there was a disconnect between the community and our product team. To reduce churn and increase retention, we need to listen to our customers. They're crucial for gauging developers' use of AI, which informs our enterprise offerings.\"\n\n### Choosing Claude\n\nSourcegraph chose Claude for its superior output quality, comprehension, consistency and reliability. \u201cClaude has been an absolute game-changer. It just feels and listens better. All we need to do is choose a Project, upload a PDF, and Claude outputs a structured report in seconds. Claude gets it 95% of the way there, and then our team adds final refinements before sending the report to the product managers,\u201d says Dorfman.\n\nSourcegraph uses Claude to synthesize and analyze the vast amounts of community feedback they collect. They\u2019ve incorporated Claude into key workflows:\n\n- Weekly community feedback reports: Claude processes data from various sources to generate comprehensive reports for the product team.\n- Competitor sentiment dashboard: Sourcegraph created a dashboard using Claude to track and compare user sentiment across competitors.\n\nDorfman elaborates, \"With Claude, we can condense data down to make sure we\u2019re not missing anything. It gives our teams a high-level view while still allowing us to link directly to specific feedback sources. This makes our work more strategic and enables our teams to create higher impact work.\"\n\n### Accelerating time to value\n\nBy integrating Claude into their feedback analysis workflow, Sourcegraph has made improvements across multiple areas of their business. By automating much of their feedback process, Claude has freed up employees to focus on high-value tasks and take action on insights quickly, increasing overall productivity.\n\nWith Claude\u2019s analysis, Sourcegraph is able to identify and address regional performance feedback, leading to more tailored solutions for their global user base. This approach has contributed to improved customer satisfaction and retention through faster issue resolution.\n\nClaude has also created a feedback loop between community input and product development. This cycle ensures that Sourcegraph's products continue to evolve in line with user needs and expectations.\n\n### Looking ahead\n\nSourcegraph plans to further integrate Claude for Work across their teams and into their workflows. They seek to explore new AI capabilities, strengthen their partnership with Anthropic, and continue focusing on open-source sustainability and community engagement.\n\nWhen reflecting on what's next, Dorfman adds, \"we look forward to pushing the limits of Claude 3.5 Sonnet to deliver high-value action items for our product team. This will improve the chat-oriented programming experience for Sourcegraph customers.\"\n\n[Share on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=https://www.anthropic.com/customers/sourcegraph-claude-for-work)[Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.anthropic.com/customers/sourcegraph-claude-for-work)",
