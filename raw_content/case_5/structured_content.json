He launched Brian Impact Foundation to support individuals and organizations using technology \u2014 especially AI \u2014 to solve social problems. Today, Brian Impact Foundation awards grants to nonprofit organizations and supports individual innovators through fellowships.\n\nBut like most nonprofits, the foundation operates with a lean team. Just 13 people manage millions of dollars in grants. \u201cEven though you try your best to go through every candidate in a very equitable way, you run out of time and resources,\u201d says Soomin Syd Kim, project director at Brian Impact Foundation.\n\n### Generative AI as a lever for scale\n\nSoomin\u2019s team turned to generative AI to help the organization expand its fellowship applicant pool and assess each candidate more thoroughly. They built a platform they call Benevolence Enhancing Expert System, or BEES, which uses Claude to turn massive amounts of data into an easy-to-read summary about potential fellows.\n\n\u201cMost of the data we use in the philanthropy sector is unstructured, so it is perfect for GenAI and large language models,\u201d Soomin says, noting that it\u2019s a similar problem faced by investors performing due diligence.\n\nWhen selecting an LLM, she was drawn to Anthropic\u2019s focus on safety, as well as Claude\u2019s capabilities. \u201cClaude\u2019s long context window was significant for us because we process a lot of news articles,\u201d she says.\n\n### Accelerating application review with Claude\n\nThe team uses BEES for two use cases: identifying prospective fellowship candidates and reviewing fellowship applications.\n\nBEES first gathers diverse types of data related to social problems and innovation from the open web. It sends the raw data to Claude to extract potential candidate information, summarize the contents, and analyze the quality, structure, and type of the data. Then, using information that meets a certain quality threshold, Claude organizes the information based on the criteria the foundation uses to assess applicants.\n\nInformation is surfaced to reviewers in a custom web app designed to make it easy for them to review everything about the prospective candidate or applicant: various kinds of information that might help Brian Impact Foundation understand their work as an innovator.\n\nPreviously, reviewers had to conduct laborious manual searches to gather information about each prospective fellow. \u201cThis is really huge in terms of improving efficiency in resource allocation,\u201d Soomin says.\n\n### How Claude drove a 100x increase in candidates\n\nPrior to selecting Anthropic for foundation models, Brian Impact Foundation relied on members of its expert network to recommend candidates for fellowships. The team knew they were potentially missing out on supporting innovators who could benefit from the foundation\u2019s support, but they simply didn\u2019t have the time or resources to broaden their search.\n\nLast year, with Claude, they reviewed over 20,000 candidates\u2014one hundred times more candidates than the previous year.\n\nClaude also accelerates the process of reviewing fellowship applications, enabling the team to study every applicant deeply and select fellows based on the most thorough review possible. \u201cWe tripled the number of reviews for each candidate,\u201d Soomin says.\n\nWith Claude, Brian Impact Foundation can be confident that it\u2019s supporting the most deserving social innovators without diverting resources away from its core mission: creating positive change.\n\n> Partnering with Anthropic has helped our team of 13 discover a larger number of fellowship applications and review every application more thoroughly. This enables us to increase equity in our fellowship application process, strengthening our mission to support innovators using technology to make the world a better place.\n\n\\- Soomin Syd Kim, Project Director at Brian Impact Foundation\n\n[Share on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=https://www.anthropic.com/customers/brian-impact-foundation)[Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.anthropic.com/customers/brian-impact-foundation)",
