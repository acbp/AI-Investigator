With Claude, Intuit:\n\n- Served millions of TurboTax customers during peak season.\n- Achieved higher helpfulness ratings compared to non-Claude-powered experiences last tax season.\n- Improved conversion rates for completed federal tax filings.\n- Increased performance and output quality through partnership with Anthropic\n\n### Making tax filing fast, accurate, and understandable\n\nIntuit\u2019s flagship product, TurboTax, helps millions of Americans accurately prepare and file their taxes each year.\n\n\"There is a lot of fear associated with doing your taxes because you're worried about unintentionally making a mistake,\" explains Nhung Ho, Vice President of AI at Intuit. \"We want to build experiences that help our customers feel much more confident at every step.\"\n\nApplying its years of domain expertise, robust data set and proprietary tax knowledge engine, Intuit worked closely with Anthropic and Amazon Web Services to further boost filer confidence by integrating Claude via Amazon Bedrock into their AI financial assistant, Intuit Assist for TurboTax. During federal tax reviews, where customers see a summary of their return, the combined work of Intuit, Anthropic and AWS provides simple explanations of tax calculations, helping users better understand how their tax result is calculated and feel assured their taxes were completed correctly.\n\n### Combining tax domain expertise with trusted AI\n\nAs an early pioneer in incorporating generative AI into their products and services, Intuit is always on the lookout for cutting-edge technologies.\n\nBy combining Claude's advanced natural language capabilities with its extensive tax knowledge engine, Intuit provides consumers with more comprehensive, precise, and helpful generative AI-powered explanations throughout the tax filing experience.\n\nIntuit\u2019s tax engine codifies more than 100,000 pages, including descriptions and interpretations of the tax code, and more than 15,000 federal tax forms and state tax forms for individual and business tax filers in the U.S. Intuit customers know they can count on TurboTax to be up to date on the latest tax laws when guiding them through the filing process.\n\nTo further optimize Claude's performance for TurboTax, Intuit collaborated extensively with Anthropic's team. \"Anthropic provides exceptional support, giving us direct access to expert researchers who help us get the most out of Claude,\" remarks Nhung. \"Our close partnership has been instrumental in pushing output quality for our customers.\"\n\n### Increasing confidence for millions of tax filers\n\nBy powering federal tax explanations with Claude, Intuit saw an increase in customer ratings on helpfulness compared to previous experiences that weren\u2019t powered by Claude. The company also observed an increased conversion rate for successful federal tax filings\u2014a win-win for customers and Intuit.\n\nNotably, Claude was able to scale to meet incredible demand, serving millions of customers during peak tax season\u2014a necessity given the concentrated nature of days when people file their taxes. Intuit could depend on Claude\u2019s safety, security, and reliability to deliver optimal performance to their end customers.\n\nLooking ahead, Nhung notes, \u201cWe are incredibly excited about Anthropic\u2019s current Claude models and future developments, as each advancement has the potential to unlock more capabilities.\u201d\n\n[Share on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=https://www.anthropic.com/customers/intuit)[Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.anthropic.com/customers/intuit)",
