Intuit, the global financial technology platform for consumers and small businesses, integrated Claude into their AI financial assistant to generate clear and accurate tax explanations for millions of TurboTax customers, driving more customers to successfully file their taxes in 2024 and boosting helpfulness ratings. With Claude, Intuit:

- Served millions of TurboTax customers during peak season.
- Achieved higher helpfulness ratings compared to non-Claude-powered experiences last tax season.
- Improved conversion rates for completed federal tax filings.
- Increased performance and output quality through partnership with Anthropic

### Making tax filing fast, accurate, and understandable

Intuit’s flagship product, TurboTax, helps millions of Americans accurately prepare and file their taxes each year.

"There is a lot of fear associated with doing your taxes because you're worried about unintentionally making a mistake," explains Nhung Ho, Vice President of AI at Intuit. "We want to build experiences that help our customers feel much more confident at every step."

Applying its years of domain expertise, robust data set and proprietary tax knowledge engine, Intuit worked closely with Anthropic and Amazon Web Services to further boost filer confidence by integrating Claude via Amazon Bedrock into their AI financial assistant, Intuit Assist for TurboTax. During federal tax reviews, where customers see a summary of their return, the combined work of Intuit, Anthropic and AWS provides simple explanations of tax calculations, helping users better understand how their tax result is calculated and feel assured their taxes were completed correctly.

### Combining tax domain expertise with trusted AI

As an early pioneer in incorporating generative AI into their products and services, Intuit is always on the lookout for cutting-edge technologies.

By combining Claude's advanced natural language capabilities with its extensive tax knowledge engine, Intuit provides consumers with more comprehensive, precise, and helpful generative AI-powered explanations throughout the tax filing experience.

Intuit’s tax engine codifies more than 100,000 pages, including descriptions and interpretations of the tax code, and more than 15,000 federal tax forms and state tax forms for individual and business tax filers in the U.S. Intuit customers know they can count on TurboTax to be up to date on the latest tax laws when guiding them through the filing process.

To further optimize Claude's performance for TurboTax, Intuit collaborated extensively with Anthropic's team. "Anthropic provides exceptional support, giving us direct access to expert researchers who help us get the most out of Claude," remarks Nhung. "Our close partnership has been instrumental in pushing output quality for our customers."

### Increasing confidence for millions of tax filers

By powering federal tax explanations with Claude, Intuit saw an increase in customer ratings on helpfulness compared to previous experiences that weren’t powered by Claude. The company also observed an increased conversion rate for successful federal tax filings—a win-win for customers and Intuit.

Notably, Claude was able to scale to meet incredible demand, serving millions of customers during peak tax season—a necessity given the concentrated nature of days when people file their taxes. Intuit could depend on Claude’s safety, security, and reliability to deliver optimal performance to their end customers.

Looking ahead, Nhung notes, “We are incredibly excited about Anthropic’s current Claude models and future developments, as each advancement has the potential to unlock more capabilities.”
