With Claude, Tome enables sales reps to:\n\n- Save hours researching accounts\n- Improve email and call conversion rates\n- Generate more qualified pipeline\n\n### Evolving from presentations to sales enablement\n\nTome started as a presentation software company, offering an alternative to PowerPoint and Google Slides. As generative AI emerged, Tome incorporated AI features like automatically generating slideshows, driving strong user growth.\n\nTome realized that while sales and marketing teams heavily used presentations, they spent even more time researching information for those decks than building them. \"As we dug deeper into their needs, we realized they spend more time researching what to include in the presentation rather than making the presentation itself,\" explained Ves Stoyanov, Head of AI at Tome.\n\n### Synthesizing data to uncover strategic insights\n\nTome pulls data from a company's sales and marketing stack alongside external sources like financial filings, websites, and news. Claude analyzes this information to generate:\n\n- A concise summary of the target account\n- Identification of the account's key strategic initiatives\n- Recommendations for positioning the product based on those initiatives.\n- Suggestions of key decision makers to contact\n\n\"We need to understand the owners' strategic priorities and initiatives, how our product relates to them, and the usual approaches to potential clients,\" said Ves. \"But you can imagine that this is a process that takes in the order of a few hours if you have to do it manually, in the depth that you would go for your important clients.\"\n\n![Tome product screenshot](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fb2b9b04ae63a8a5d37ae71f24783482314735742-1920x1080.jpg&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Claude outperforms in accuracy, context, and coherence\n\nWhen evaluating AI models for their sales use case, Tome found that Claude delivered better results than other alternatives they explored.\n\n> When we compared Claude to other models for generating sales strategies, Claude consistently delivered better results. It was better at citing specific information from the source documents instead of making things up. Claude could also handle a larger volume of input data through its longer context window. Most importantly, the quality of the sales strategies Claude generated was higher\u2014 they were more coherent and actionable. So for helping reps strategize how to approach target accounts, Claude was the winner.\n\n\u2014 Ves Stoyanov, Head of AI\n\n### Driving sales productivity and relevance\n\nBy automating the research process, Tome enables sales reps to engage accounts faster. \"Time savings is huge,\" noted Sarin Devraj, Tome executive. Tome expects to improve key sales metrics like emails sent, calls made, and conversion rates.\n\nMore importantly, Claude's insights allow reps to reach out with messaging relevant to the account's most pressing priorities. Sarin explained, \"At the end of the day, what signals whether a company needs your product is their overall strategic initiatives happening at that business.\"\n\n### Looking forward\n\nTome sees an opportunity to close the loop between research, strategy, and execution. The company envisions starting with deep research capabilities powered by Claude, and expanding to help sales teams through the entire journey\u2014from identifying opportunities to creating compelling presentations and understanding prospect engagement. \"We strongly believe that AI isn't a moment, it's the future,\" said Ves.\n\nTome is pioneering a new approach that delivers real value to sales teams by focusing on extracting and synthesizing insights rather than just generating content. They're moving beyond simple intent signals like job changes or website visits to uncover true strategic alignment between companies and products. With their sales domain expertise, technical excellence, and Claude's advanced capabilities, Tome is poised to transform modern sales teams\u2014making them more strategic, efficient, and ultimately more successful in delivering value to their customers.\n\n[Share on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=https://www.anthropic.com/customers/tome)[Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.anthropic.com/customers/tome)",
