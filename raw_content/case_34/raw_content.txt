# Wedia Group advances digital asset management with Claude

Wedia Group, a leading provider of digital asset management (DAM) solutions, uses Claude to transform how their customers organize, search, and utilize their visual content. Wedia powers their platform with Claude in Amazon Bedrock to improve metadata generation, multilingual support, and overall user experience for its clients.

With Claude, Wedia saw:

- Ability to process 20,000-30,000 new images per month
- Reduction in image metadata tagging time
- Support for 20+ languages in image descriptions

### The challenge: Organizing vast libraries of visual content

Wedia's clients, which include major enterprises and brands, generate thousands of images and videos monthly that need to be tagged, organized, and made searchable in their DAM system. Manually tagging this volume of content was time-consuming and led to inconsistent or incomplete metadata.

"We have clients who produce thousands of images per month, 20,000 to 30,000 images. And we need to allow everyone to access and promote them," said Olivier Grenet, CTO and co-founder of Wedia. "The real issue is finding the image."

Wedia needed a solution to automatically generate accurate, detailed metadata for images at scale, supporting multiple languages for their global client base.

### Wedia’s approach to AI security

Wedia also required a robust, enterprise-level security solution to protect their customers' data. “We partnered with Anthropic because privacy is paramount to us and our clients,” says Olivier. “With another LLM provider, we were told that images would remain private, but the communication was vague, and we couldn’t assure our customers that their data was secure. With Anthropic and Amazon Bedrock’s privacy-centric architecture and transparent approach, we trust there are no data leaks, and can communicate that trust to our clients.”

### Using Claude to simplify metadata generation and provide multilingual support

Wedia integrated Claude into their DAM platform to automatically analyze and describe images uploaded by clients. Users can generate metadata including captions, object detection, scene description, and other attributes with a single click. Olivier says, “An image passes through Claude's Vision model with the click of one small, magnificent button and brings back a lot of information.”

Claude can describe images with the domain-specific detail Wedia's clients need. For automotive clients, Claude doesn't just identify a truck in an image - it specifies the model, color, features, and positioning. Olivier adds, "Our customers were telling us, 'Great, you're telling me there are trucks in my images. I produce trucks, I'm aware of that. What interests me are the details like models, colors, and positioning. Exactly what Claude can provide.'"

Claude's multilingual capabilities were also a key factor for Wedia. The system can automatically generate image descriptions in over 20 languages, better serving multinational enterprise clients.

"Claude allows all this information to be brought together in several languages," noted Olivier. "The translation tools provided through Claude automatically translate the caption and metadata into multiple languages."

### Efficiency gains and quality improvements with Claude

The integration of Claude has dramatically improved both the efficiency and quality of Wedia's DAM solution. Metadata generation time has been reduced by 90%, while the accuracy and detail of image descriptions have significantly increased. Clients report a 70% improvement in their ability to quickly find relevant images.

Wedia can now easily process 20,000-30,000 new client images per month, removing a major bottleneck in their workflow. The system also enables rapid ingestion of legacy image libraries - what previously took 6 months of manual work can now be completed in 2 weeks.

### The future of AI-powered DAM

Looking ahead, Wedia sees Claude as a key enabler of their product roadmap, with a focus on empowering creative professionals. The company plans to expand Claude's role to include generating social media content, providing AI-assisted creative collaboration tools, and developing more intuitive, conversational search interfaces. These advancements aim to free up creatives to focus on higher-value tasks and unleash their full creative potential.

> Claude lets clients do in seconds what used to take hours. It puts AI power in creatives’ and marketers’ hands through an intuitive experience they can trust. We are just beginning to unlock this incredible toolbox for the future of DAM with Claude.
