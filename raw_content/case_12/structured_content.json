Claude helped Gamma lower costs while increasing user satisfaction by 30% and free-to-paid conversions by 20%.\n\n### A viral launch powered by generative AI\n\nGamma was founded in 2020 to help invent a new way for people to share ideas. Initially, co-founders Jon Noronha, Grant Lee, and James Fox focused on improving the traditional presentation format, which hadn\u2019t changed much since PowerPoint introduced the concept of 16x9 slides in the 1980s. Early explorations were fruitful, but didn\u2019t feel compelling enough.\n\nFast forward to 2022, and the widespread availability of image generators and large language models put the team on a new path. \u201cWe were in between product-market fit,\u201d Jon explains. \u201cPeople liked our product, there was clearly promise, but it was missing that really strong hook that gave people a reason to abandon something they were really familiar with to use it.\u201d\n\nGenerative AI became that hook. Gamma launched their app with a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9VOYJM6nZc) that quickly went viral. \u201cEver since then, it\u2019s been a runaway train,\u201d Jon says. Users immediately loved Gamma for two main use cases: generating presentations from scratch and iterating on slide content and design.\n\n![App screen from Gamma platform](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F28bf834aca6299bd34add845729396d0cf2b6df2-2880x1620.jpg&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAs it became clear that the AI generation flow was a primary driver of Gamma\u2019s business growth, the team started to dig into the data to understand just how well their initial LLM choices were performing.\n\nThey discovered that while the LLMs performed well on simple tasks, such as one-line prompts in English, they struggled with more advanced concepts, such as turning a long document into a presentation. User feedback on more advanced use cases was about 50% positive and 50% negative. \u201cThat\u2019s an F,\u201d says Jon. \u201cSo we were on the lookout for ways to improve.\u201d\n\n### Lower costs, improved performance\n\nThe team was initially drawn to Claude for its state of the art performance and cost-effective price point, which had become a concern as the company\u2019s viral growth continued to scale. As a result, they decided to A/B test Claude 3 Haiku against their existing solution.\n\nAfter a quick implementation, the team had Claude up and running\u2014and the results surprised them. \u201cIn our evaluations, Claude 3 Haiku exceeded our previous LLM on output quality, in spite of being significantly more cost-effective for our business.\u201d Jon says. \u201cI had expected similar quality for lower cost, but Claude 3 Haiku exceeded our expectations.\u201d\n\nIn fact, positive feedback for advanced use cases increased 30%. Gamma users responded particularly well to Claude\u2019s voice and tone. \u201cPeople had been frustrated that the tone of all of these presentations sounded the same,\u201d Jon says, adding that the previous LLM\u2019s tone was \u201cvery salesy.\u201d Users appreciated Claude\u2019s more neutral tone and ability to adapt to different audiences.\n\n### Taking on the next phase of growth\n\nBased on the positive outcome of the A/B test, Gamma quickly shipped the new version of their app to production\u2014and that initial 30% improvement in user satisfaction has driven a 20% increase in conversions from free to paid.\n\n![App screen from Gamma platform](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F67439d21381bf144c10475711fce55ea88f2d10b-2880x1620.jpg&w=3840&q=75)\n\nToday, Claude powers well over half of Gamma\u2019s AI features. Though they consider themselves an AI-native company, they no longer feel sharp pressure to aggressively hire AI specialists onto their 16-person team, which supports 17 million users. \u201cOne benefit of models like Claude being so good is that we haven\u2019t had to build a huge team around AI,\u201d Jon says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to focus more on productizing the experience versus training our own models or even fine-tuning them, because there\u2019s already so much we can do.\u201d\n\nFor their next act, Gamma is taking on websites. The team recently released a feature\u2014 powered by Claude\u2014that lets people use AI to create and publish a website on their chosen domain. With a strong user base, a compelling vision, and a recent Series A led by Accel Partners, they\u2019re well-positioned to succeed.\n\n> Implementing Claude took a couple days and about ten lines of code. Claude has driven 30% improvement in user satisfaction, which has translated into a 20% improvement in our free-to-pay conversion rate.\n\n\u2014 Jon Noronha, Co-Founder at Gamma\n\n[Share on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=https://www.anthropic.com/customers/gamma)[Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.anthropic.com/customers/gamma)",
