Claude helps lawyers quickly find relevant information across vast transcripts, saving them from manually gathering and reading thousands of pages at a time.\n\n### Analyzing long legal transcripts\n\nSteno provides legal support services, such as court reporting and remote depositions, to more than 1200 law firms across the United States. These legal proceedings are captured in transcripts. Attorneys often look at previous transcripts to understand, for example, how an expert witness responds to certain types of questions or whether a witness has been inconsistent in their testimony in the past.\n\nFor firms that don\u2019t use Steno, these transcripts are often stored on attorneys\u2019 desktops or Google Drives. Finding a transcript requires sending an email to colleagues (\u201cHas anyone deposed this expert witness before?\u201d). Then, someone must scour several individual transcripts\u2014each of which might be hundreds of pages long\u2014for relevant information.\n\nSteno solved this problem by offering firms centralized storage for all of their Steno transcripts. But founders Dan Anderson, Greg Hong, and Dylan Ruga saw an opportunity to go much further with generative AI.\n\n\"When we asked attorneys what other technology we could build for a better litigation experience, they frequently mentioned the time-consuming and tedious nature of reading and analyzing transcripts,\u201d explains Co-Founder Greg Hong. \u201cWhen we saw what Claude could do, building Transcript Genius was a no-brainer.\u201d\n\n### Legal analysis requires crucial context\n\nSteno chose Claude 3 Opus to drive Transcript Genius, its AI-powered transcript analysis platform. Steno had explored AI solutions in the past, but at first, legal transcripts were too long for the available LLMs to handle. Once Claude\u2019s 200K context window hit the market, the team knew they had the tools they needed to realize their product vision.\n\n\u201cWe had a proof of concept up within a week,\u201d says Dan Anderson, Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer at Steno, noting that they were able to build everything needed with one and a half engineers on the project.\n\n![App screen from Steno platform](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F610ac849a318af8e2f873d14d2d2d54756496269-1920x1080.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### A solution attorneys can trust\n\nWith Transcript Genius, attorneys can easily search, analyze, and interrogate their firm\u2019s entire repository of transcripts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m litigating a legal malpractice case right now, and I asked the model to find all evidence of legal malpractice in a particular transcript,\u201d says Dylan Ruga, President and Chief Legal Officer at Steno. \u201cThe model was able to understand four things you need to prove legal malpractice and find specific evidence relevant to those four things, which is super impressive, because there was nothing in the transcript itself that talked about the elements of proving a legal malpractice case.\u201d\n\n![App screen of the Steno platform](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F2caa3ebeed93bcbaa3b9c4a2be69737d1f5ad5e4-3840x2160.jpg&w=3840&q=75)\n\nIn the legal world, attorneys need to trust in a system before they can rely on it, and the legal world has been rightfully skeptical of many players in the generative AI space. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard horror stories of other models citing cases that don\u2019t actually exist. We want to build trust with our customers, and working with a high-integrity model like Claude helps preserve that trust,\u201d Dan says.\n\nSteno used prompt engineering to ensure that Transcript Genius gives accurate results and provides a hyperlink to the exact location it\u2019s citing within a transcript. This is especially useful to legal professionals, as formatting is inconsistent across different types of transcripts. By giving Claude plenty of guidance on how different transcripts were formatted, Steno was able to achieve the level of accuracy that attorneys demand.\n\n### Exposing attorneys to the power of AI\n\nTranscript Genius streamlines a previously time-consuming, error-prone workflow. Historically, attorneys have been limited by their own capacity to find and read transcripts. Thanks to Claude and the Steno engineering team, attorneys can bypass searching and analysis and focus their attention on building the strongest case possible.\n\n\u201cMost attorneys aren\u2019t following the latest advancements in the AI world,\u201d Dan adds. \u201cFor a lot of them, this is their first time being exposed to a model of Claude\u2019s caliber. And it\u2019s kind of mind-blowing for them.\u201d\n\n[Share on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=https://www.anthropic.com/customers/steno)[Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.anthropic.com/customers/steno)",
