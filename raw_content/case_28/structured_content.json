In 2023, it introduced Cody: an artificial intelligence (AI) coding assistant designed to help developers write and understand code faster. By analyzing the entire codebase, Cody provides context-aware chat and other valuable tools that take into account the full project scope rather than relying on isolated code snippets, significantly accelerating software development.\n\n\u201cCody accelerates the inner loop of software development,\u201d says Beyang Liu, Chief Technology Officer and Cofounder of Sourcegraph. \u201cIt has features like inline completions, codebase-aware chat, inline editing, and tools that alleviate some of the day-to-day burdens that developers experience. This accelerates the pace at which they\u2019re able to write code.\u201d\n\nFrom its initial release, Cody has allowed developers to select Claude as the large language model powering its features. In 2024, Sourcegraph made the entire Claude 3 model family\u2014Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus\u2014accessible to developers on every Cody plan.\n\n\u201cClaude 3 models excel at following instructions, generating production-ready code without requiring manual intervention or code snippets,\u201d says Philipp Spiess, Software Engineer at Sourcegraph. \u201cWe\u2019re confident that it effectively meets developers\u2019 needs and propels their projects forward.\u201d\n\n![App screen in the Sourcegraph platform](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Ffc97a3d875ed8314630ad40dfe8e35a04f8aa319-1568x882.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Improving developer workflows with the Claude 3 model family\n\nOptimized for different levels of speed and intelligence, each Claude 3 model excels at different functions within Cody while helping Sourcegraph keep its costs low without compromising quality.\n\nClaude 3 Sonnet serves as the default model for the free version of Cody, with improved coding abilities and two times the speed of Anthropic\u2019s previous model, Claude 2.1. Pro and Enterprise users can take advantage of Opus, Anthropic\u2019s most powerful model with industry-leading coding abilities and long-context recall accuracy. Devs also have the option of using Haiku\u2014Anthropic\u2019s fastest model\u2014for use cases where rapid responses are critical.\n\nThe Claude 3 model family is integral to Cody\u2019s chat and custom command features. Developers can ask questions and receive answers related to their entire codebase, which helps quickly resolve issues and understand complex code interactions. They can also request Cody to perform specific tasks, such as refactoring code or generating documentation, with the custom commands feature. With the near-perfect recall accuracy of Claude 3 Opus, Cody gives developers even better results because it can understand large amounts of code context without missing key information.\n\n![App screen in the Sourcegraph platform](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F363b03799e5077e2f14ba6761d6a9299fb95062e-1738x882.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve decided to use Claude as our default chat model in Cody,\u201d says Liu. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic at incorporating the context we provide into accurate answers about a user\u2019s private codebase and writing code that fits within the context of your code. The family of models, from Opus to Haiku, provides several great points along the frontier of speed and intelligence that power multiple Cody features.\u201d\n\n### Achieving more accurate results for developers\n\nSourcegraph\u2019s AI assistant, now enhanced by Claude, has transformed the coding experience for developers. Since rolling out Claude 3 Sonnet as the default model to Cody Free users, Sourcegraph has seen an approximate 75 percent increase in code insert rate; Cody users are taking almost twice as much code from Cody\u2019s suggestions and inserting it directly into their files, which indicates an increase in code quality.\n\nClaude 3 Sonnet delivers chat and command responses at twice the speed of its predecessor, which further accelerates the coding process. Sourcegraph also saw that roughly 55 percent of Cody Pro users switched their default model to the new Claude 3 models in the month following the launch.\n\nSourcegraph plans to expand Cody\u2019s capabilities even further. The company has launched an experimental project to bring more context sources into its integrated development environment, such as system monitoring metrics, to enhance the accuracy and relevancy of the code suggestions. This improvement will take advantage of the large 200K context window available in every Claude 3 model, which will set the stage for even more sophisticated AI interactions. \u201cOur users will soon have the ability to reliably generate code changes, especially with the Claude 3 Haiku model,\u201d says Spiess. \u201cBefore, no model offered the latency required to make code edits. We\u2019re now prototyping features with this use case so that we can make the most out of these capabilities.\u201d\n\nThese advancements will help solidify Cody as an essential tool in a developer\u2019s repository, and Anthropic is working closely with Sourcegraph to make these upgrades possible. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy with our partnership with Anthropic,\u201d says Liu. \u201cThe team has been absolutely a delight to work with\u2014super helpful and super sharp. We\u2019re looking forward to continuing to build with Claude to push the frontier of AI coding capabilities.\u201d\n\n[Share on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=https://www.anthropic.com/customers/sourcegraph)[Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.anthropic.com/customers/sourcegraph)",
