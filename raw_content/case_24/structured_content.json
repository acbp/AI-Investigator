Notion AI Writer debuted in November 2022, two weeks before before the most popular AI models hit the market. \u201cNotion AI Writer democratized writing power in the context of your Notion workspace and drove growth with our consumer audience,\u201d Last says.\n\nNotion\u2019s latest release integrates AI functionality across its application\u2014powered in part by Claude. Claude introduced new capabilities like improved search, Q&A through RAG, and an AI assistant that brings it all together. This enabled Notion to launch features like Q&A, AI Connectors, and the brand new Notion AI--search, generation, analysis, and chat, all right inside the platform.\n\n### Transforming knowledge work with Claude-powered AI\n\nClaude enables Notion to offer its customers a more intelligent, responsive, and user-friendly experience. This helps to position the company at the forefront of AI-augmented productivity tools, driving business growth and user satisfaction.\n\nNow, Claude is central to Notion\u2019s AI, offering a unified assistant that uses Claude\u2019s for:\n\n- AI Writer: A writing and editing assistant that helps users create and refine content more efficiently.\n- Autofill: An intelligent system that automatically populates database fields, saving time on data entry.\n- Q&A: A universal search tool that answers questions about any content in a user\u2019s workspace.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve integrated our retrieval system throughout the platform, including in our writing assistance,\u201d Last explained. \u201cThis allows users to instantly access relevant information from their entire workspace, whether drafting a document or asking a specific question.\u201d\n\n![Notion product screen](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fd67034af7078c10d31e5c622fff38a0ffbf3799e-1600x858.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n![Notion product screenshot](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F5f166365aa82cafd9b98ca123a4bec0558cf96a4-1920x1034.jpg&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Delivering measurable impact at scale\n\nNotion\u2019s use of Claude across its products has transformed how its customers access and utilize their company\u2019s collective knowledge. This leads to significant cost savings and enhanced productivity for Notion\u2019s customers.\n\nClaude improves Notion\u2019s performance and scalability. Notion users who use Q&A ask an average of 2.7 questions per day, with a majority reporting they save at least 5 minutes of work time per question. For businesses of every size, these time savings compound dramatically:\n\n- Osaka Gas, with approximately 3,000 employees, estimates a 35% reduction in time spent searching for information\n- [Remote.com](http://Remote.com), with around 1,400 employees, saves an estimated 10 minutes per search and executes 300 Q&A queries per day\n\nCompared to previous AI tools, Claude delivered higher helpfulness ratings and improved task completion rates. Claude\u2019s advanced generative AI capabilities scale for Notion\u2019s millions of users during peak periods without compromising performance, ensuring consistent user satisfaction as its customer base expands.\n\nClaude's value extends across diverse use cases. Customer support teams quickly locate troubleshooting steps, new sales reps efficiently learn Salesforce processes, and product designers instantly find brand guidelines. For companies like dbt Labs, this comprehensive functionality has translated to over $35k in annual savings by eliminating the need for additional enterprise AI or search tools.\n\nThe AI assistant powered by Claude has has proven particularly transformative for employee onboarding. \u201cWhen someone new joins the company, they use it 10-20 times daily,\u201d Last shared. \u201cWe get consistent feedback that it\u2019s amazingly useful for the first few weeks.\u201d\n\nBy creating a more intelligent, responsive workspace powered by Claude, Notion delivers measurable benefits that scale across teams, use cases, and organizations of all sizes.\n\n### Choosing Claude for performance, personality, and ease of implementation\n\nWhen evaluating AI partners, Notion sought a solution that could deliver superior performance while maintaining its high standards for user experience and ease of implementation. Claude emerged as the clear leader across all criteria.\n\n\u201cClaude powers many use cases where we really care about the response\u2019s feel and vibe,\u201d said Last. The team was particularly impressed by Claude\u2019s reasoning and instruction-following capabilities, conversational tone that creates natural, helpful interactions, and balanced approach to safety and refusals. \u201cClaude\u2019s model quality really impressed us\u2014especially as we wanted to expand to one-click skills where certain tasks like writing and editing were better served by Anthropic\u2019s models,\u201d Last noted. Ultimately, they found Claude to be \u201cthe best across the board.\u201d\n\nNotion is also using prompt caching to reduce costs by 90% and latency by up to 85%. \u201cPrompt caching makes Notion AI faster and cheaper, all while maintaining state-of-the-art quality. This enables us to create a more elevated and responsive user experience for our customers,\u201d said Last.\n\nNotion's integration of Claude was seamless. \u201cImplementing Claude was as simple as changing a flag and doing some offline evaluations,\u201d Last explained. Prompt caching enabled Notion to balance costs and speed, while Claude\u2019s voice and tone matched user expectations perfectly. The straightforward evaluation and testing process further simplified implementation.\n\n### Shaping the future of augmented knowledge work\n\nNotion is transforming knowledge management from static information repositories into a dynamic, intelligent workspace that enhances your thinking and productivity. For Notion, AI isn\u2019t just about automation\u2014it\u2019s about empowering everyone \u201cto do their best work.\u201d\n\nThe partnership with Anthropic uniquely positions Notion to lead this transformation. With Claude, Notion plans to improve database support and writer capabilities and expand data sources through more AI connectors and web search. They'll do this while ensuring that superior retrieval and search quality continue to differentiate its platform.\n\nAs the landscape of knowledge work evolves, Notion remains focused on ensuring AI amplifies rather than replaces human capabilities. Through Notion\u2019s partnership with Anthropic, they\u2019re creating a future where technology doesn\u2019t just store our collective knowledge\u2014it helps us leverage it in more powerful and meaningful ways.\n\n[Share on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=https://www.anthropic.com/customers/notion)[Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.anthropic.com/customers/notion)",
